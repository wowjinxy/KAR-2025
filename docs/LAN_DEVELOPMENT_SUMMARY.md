## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Assembly Syntax Issues
- **Problem**: Custom `.fn`/`.endfn` directives not recognized by assembler
- **Solution**: Replace with standard assembly syntax and comments
- **Status**: Identified, ready for implementation

### Challenge 2: Function Naming
- **Problem**: Cryptic function names like `fn_8047A634`
- **Solution**: Created descriptive names based on behavior analysis
- **Status**: Completed, ready for integration

### Challenge 3: Build System Configuration
- **Problem**: System trying to compile source files instead of using assembly
- **Solution**: Configured `asm_dir` and removed source file dependencies
- **Status**: Completed, working correctly

## Benefits of Current Work
